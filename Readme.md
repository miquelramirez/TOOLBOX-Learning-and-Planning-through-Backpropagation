Tensorflow Coding Examples

# Introduction
The code were generated for my research projects, but as a byproduct, they are complete and standard tensorflow implementations of Deep Learning. I code them in Object Orientated Programming(OOP) style, which hopely is easy for people to understand. I am more than happy to share them as a tutorial examples for people who struggling to learn Tensorflow. If you are going to use this code directly into your project and has some questions, please contact me through email or linkedin. I am always happy to help.

# What is in the repository
This repository currently has three network implementations.

1. Fully Connected Neural Network
2. (Conditional) Variational AutoEncoder with "Gating"(used to solve backpropagation problem in near deterministic domain) (Supervised for CondVAE and Unsupervised VAE)
3. Recurrent Neural Network for Value Function Approximation in Reinforcement Learning (Unsupervised)

# What is the difference with other tutorials
I personally do not like official tensorflow tutorials, because they do not provide some details on how to implement complete workable networks. The knowledge you can get here include:

1. Save and load trained weights through CSV files
2. Save and load specific Varibles through Saver
3. Output single final prediction from the last iteration of RNN but not a sequence of outputs.
4. Full workable network examples
